            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This research investigates the field of intelligent sports engineering, addressing the limitations of traditional racket-based sports training that over-relies on coaches' subjective experience. It innovatively presents the IntelliTrain visual analytics system framework, which deeply integrates Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technologies, to provide athletes with precise data-driven training support.
The architectural framework of the IntelliTrain system comprises three core modules. First is the Device Configuration Module, responsible for the precise orchestration of various IoT devices to ensure stable data acquisition in complex training environments. This involves optimizing critical parameters such as sensor types, sampling frequencies, and installation positions. Second is the Data Parsing Module, which employs advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms to conduct deep mining of massive raw sensor data while fusing multimodal datasets. This module accurately identifies the technical attributes of athletes' hitting actions (e.g., forehand and backhand strokes) and key performance indicators (e.g., ball velocity, spin rate). Lastly, the Results Visualization Module utilizes intuitive visual design to transform complex training data, technical analysis outcomes, and optimization suggestions into visual modalities amenable to sports scientific analysis. This enables coaches to perform real-time monitoring of athletes' performance during training and make timely adjustments to training strategies.
The innovative contributions of this study are manifested in three dimensions. First, it successfully establishes the first integrated IoT-AI framework for racket sports training, effectively addressing issues such as inadequate data utilization and delayed feedback in traditional training models. Second, a complete prototype system for table tennis training has been developed, which through multi-case validation, demonstrates its effectiveness and practicality in enhancing athletes' hitting techniques. Third, it presents novel research perspectives and technical paradigms for the field of intelligent sports engineering, showcasing the enormous application potential of IoT devices and AI algorithms in sports training. This work lays a solid theoretical and practical foundation for future expansions to other sports disciplines (e.g., tennis, badminton) and team sports training scenarios.
